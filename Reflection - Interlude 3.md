In Module 3, we worked a lot with high-speed semi-automated genre fiction/ AI-Generated Text With GPT-2 in class, which as a writer, was fascinating to me how the OpenAI model could generate grammatically coherent text from custom datasets. In class, I had uploaded Charles Dickens' Great Expectations into Max Woolfe's Colaboratory Notebook and was able to engage with the text. I should have chosen a historical text from The Gutenburg Project to generate a historian's perspective. However, according to Alan Liu, ChatGPT and other large-language-model discourse generators, despite having a certain eloquence (what he describes as "rhetorical, stylistic, and/or aesthetic effectiveness"), it lacks originality (creativity) and informativeness because they are texts generated from knowledge that is already out there. 

The concept of GPT-2 as a black box that is taking in inputs and providing outputs, as mentioned by Woolfe in his blog, is very similar to the research I'm doing for my Unessay on DALL-E and how it homogenizes/culturally appropriates Indigenous cultures, especially in museum contexts. Professor Graham had provided me with two article links that revealed how text-to-image generation AI models are also like a "black box" and revealed where on the internet the dataset or web images they were trained on came from. That took me on a deep dive (https://laion-aesthetic.datasette.io/laion-aesthetic-6pls/images?_search=totem+poles&_sort=rowid) that revealed how AI was using images of Indigenous cultural objects used in ceremonies like the headress and totem poles that came from retail sites that were non-Indigenous but "Native American-inspired" - retail websites (that also sold their products on Amazon) that profited from culturally appropriating Indigenous culture. It confirmed how there is an illusion that AI technology is “neutral” and “unbiased." They are in fact, "bias engines" and through critical engagement and analysis, which I hope to do in my Unessay, these tools can be used to visualize gaps, absences, exclusions and presence in human-generated datasets online. 

I connected this to an example of playful engagement with history provided in the reading "The Interactive Past" from Module 2. The video game Never Alone (Upper One Games 2014) was based on traditional Iñupiaq stories and made in collaboration with the Iñupiaq community. The need for collaboration with Indigenous communities in order to create a game that tells their stories reaffirmed how my Unessay should clearly be autobiographical and told from my perspective (as mentioned in my feedback for interlude 2:  a play through of how Nehaa Bimal approached a very contentious area of research and a very particular social/cultural sphere?). I am not sure if this kind of play through fits under Nguyen's categories for "striving play" but if it did, it would be _Intrinsic striving play_ which is is "play for the sake of the intrinsic value of engagement in the activity of play." My concept is that anyone can enagage with history in an educational way, in this case as a journalist with little historical background knowledge. 

In the video game Never Alone, the concept was to tackle stereotypes that plagued Indigenous communities. In fact,  Never Alone’s art director met with Iñupiaq artists and even visited the Anchorage Museum in Alaska to look at authentic Native art, tools, and clothes. Based on the Iñupiaq culture and craft he witnessed, Veryovka created the visual style of the game developing artwork that accurately represented Alaska Native people and culture. This is very important when creating games that incorporate not only history, but cultural groups throughout history.

When we "raised the dead" in class using GPT-2, the role of the historian is to provide the material by which the machine creates experiences for the user; we provide the context, the machine creates the elements and experiences. I was reading the article on AI Dungeon and was fascinated by how the game's GPT core went off script was able to imitate text styles from its training set and find other web content, allowing the user to have an interview with an AI-generated Mahatma Gandhi which emulated his speaking style and his life story from historical facts online. This is playful way of engaging with history in a personalized, interactive way ad discussed in the storytelling module. I was playing the AI Dungeon game The World of Fiomar and realized that while the user could interact with the fantasy story in any way by answering the prompt, "What do you say?," the fantasy world and its parameters are determined by the creator. So even in experiences and elements that are emergent, there are still limitations to how far an AI's "so-called imagination" can go. The player's _strategies_, _choices_, behaviors (as per the core compoents of the historical problem space) are still required in an AI-generated game to reach the designed goals, which can change within the constraints of the game's virtual space.
